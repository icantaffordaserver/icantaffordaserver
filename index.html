				<p class='section-content'>Originally a student of clinical psychology, I graduated the University of Waterloo with a passion for coding.
					I took my very first computer science course halfway into my academic career, hoping to learn how to write some simple Python scripts to 
					automate my data analysis workload. I soon realized that I enjoyed coding a lot more than I enjoyed my current field. From there, I used 
					what I learned from Psychology and applied it to the field of visual and UX design. I was able to find a marketing job in tech, then a UX 
					Designer position, eventually ending up as a Product Designer at a local startup.<br><br>
					In addition to my work interests, I game as much as I dance as much I love dogs. Although I've performed hip hop sets at a number of non-profit events,
					my gaming career is not as colourful. That being said, I'm still always down to meet new friends on Summoner's Rift!
